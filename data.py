        "year": 1992,
        "synopsis": "A meticulously planned diamond heist goes catastrophically wrong when police arrive at the scene too quickly, suggesting an informant among the color-coded criminal crew. In the aftermath, the surviving thieves - Mr. White, Mr. Orange, Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and others - retreat to a warehouse hideout where paranoia, violence, and mistrust consume the group. Through flashbacks and real-time tension, the film explores themes of loyalty, betrayal, and honor among thieves. Mr. Orange, bleeding profusely from a gunshot wound, struggles with a devastating secret while Mr. Blonde's psychopathic torture of a captured police officer reveals the crew's fracturing moral codes. The non-linear narrative builds to a Mexican standoff where trust dissolves completely, and the truth about the undercover cop infiltrating their ranks leads to a tragic climax of violence and revelation.",
